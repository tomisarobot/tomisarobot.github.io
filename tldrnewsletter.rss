The dealer had purchased the vehicle directly from Tesla at an auction. Tesla claims that the customer didn't pay for the features so therefore they aren't eligible to use them. The features were enabled when the dealer bought the car and the customer purchased the car under the assumption the features would be included. Tesla says that the customer will have to pay $8,000 to turn the features back on. This incident raises hard questions about the problems that over-the-air updates can cause.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F02%2F05%2Fhoop-snapchat-app%2F/1/010001702ed394e4-21a157ed-3b97-487f-822a-42ba0a4e6fa6-000000/JWA-eCzp7UoyoO1JGOkN3AKBxelSlxhMM5ydNEKs6Ak=127" target="_blank">How Hoop hit #2 with its Tinder for Snapchat (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Snapchat's Snap Kit allows developers to integrate Snapchat features into their apps. Hoop, a Tinder-like app developed on Snap Kit, quickly saw 2.5 million downloads after its launch. The app allows users to find new Snapchat friends with a swiping system. Users are limited in the number of people they can swipe through a 'diamond' currency system. Credits can be earned by engaging with the app. Users over 18 will not be able to see users who are under 18, and vice versa. By opening Snapchat up to developers, a Snapchat account could become a must-have for anyone who wants to use the next generation of apps.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2Fs%2F615163%2Fa-dark-web-tycoon-pleads-guilty-but-how-was-he-caught%2F/1/010001702ed394e4-21a157ed-3b97-487f-822a-42ba0a4e6fa6-000000/yApnotel7tQIxFB87nqmnJ20n--BkRqo3iUAO9O0gD8=127" target="_blank">A dark web tycoon pleads guilty. But how was he caught? (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Eric Marques recently pleaded guilty for running a hosting service that served drug markets, money-laundering operations, hacking groups, and millions of images of child abuse. Freedom Hosting ran sites on the dark web and Marques ran his operation behind many layers of anonymity.  Marques was using the Tor network, a technology that was designed to provide complete anonymity. In early August 2013, users noticed unknown Javascript code running on websites hosted on Freedom Hosting. Hours later, all of the sites went down simultaneously. The code targeted a Firefox vulnerability that could unmask Tor users, but the technicalities are still a mystery. There is a formal system for reporting vulnerabilities and deciding whether an issue should be shared. The FBI would not reveal exactly how Marques' anonymity was broken, a decision that could have wide-ranging cybersecurity implications.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F8%2F21120233%2Fsolar-orbiter-spacecraft-nasa-esa-mission-sun-poles/1/010001702ed394e4-21a157ed-3b97-487f-822a-42ba0a4e6fa6-000000/0UDj5dqswWz94T_AsRA6cFI5EgLYh6JJ6OBJGe9rFWc=127" target="_blank">A new spacecraft is journeying to the Sun to get a never-before-seen look at the star‚Äôs poles (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The ESA and NASA are launching a spaceship towards the sun to study its poles in order to better predict how it behaves. Until now, all vehicles sent to the Sun have orbited around its equator. Solar Orbit will gather data on the Sun's strange 11-year cycle, where it alternates between times of intense activity and times of quiet. During the transition between cycles, the Sun's magnetic field completely switches direction and the poles flip and trade places. Solar maximum describes a period during which sunspots dominate the Sun's surface, and solar minimum is a period when the Sun's surface is relatively sunspot-free. The sunspot cycle coincides with the amount of energy the Sun emits. Solar Orbiter is protected by a heat shield that can withstand temperatures of more than 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. It is set to launch late Sunday night from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="http://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/http:%2F%2Fverraes.net%2F2020%2F01%2Fwall-of-technical-debt%2F/1/010001702ed394e4-21a157ed-3b97-487f-822a-42ba0a4e6fa6-000000/xQ77R8gVe5M8yDnXY_L6qquzAuVe-d5Hd-LewkRAzg8=127" target="_blank">The Wall of Technical Debt (6 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Technical debt is used to describe software design choices that turn out to be suboptimal, no longer valid, or just plain wrong. All aspects of development can suffer from technical debt, such as architecture, documentation, tests, and domain models. It can cause problems in the future with maintaining and upgrading code, but it can also help developers quickly build inexpensive tests. Managing technical debt is key to making sure it doesn't affect your business negatively. This may involve making the debt visible, constantly reevaluating decisions, making compromises, and communicating priorities clearly. It's always best to try to convert intangibles into numbers that others can understand.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgofiber%2Ffiber/1/010001702ed394e4-21a157ed-3b97-487f-822a-42ba0a4e6fa6-000000/WJOa6C-CQI2n03xX7D0pxVuRU4TNUMQj4efBmRqzM5k=127" target="_blank">Fiber (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Fiber is an Expressjs-inspired web framework designed for fast development with zero memory allocation.

The tech company  started to introduce healthy food over the past five years. Google's campaign didn't just focus on changing the food, but how food was presented as well. Its goal was to make the healthy choice the easy and preferred choice. The project resulted in people eating more healthy and sustainable foods while avoiding unhealthy choices. Google's strategy shows that how much people stick with virtuous patterns of behavior has less to do with the logical reasons for why they should do things, and more to do with how enjoyable that virtuous thing is to do.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2020%2Ffeb%2F09%2Fbill-gates-orders-500m-hydrogen-powered-superyacht/1/010001702ed394e4-21a157ed-3b97-487f-822a-42ba0a4e6fa6-000000/HquAdtgXuQN94Bm144gcYGtSDP5_nduq6h0THXfBwl4=127" target="_blank">Bill Gates orders ¬£500m hydrogen-powered superyacht (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Bill Gates has ordered the world's first hydrogen-powered superyacht for around $644 million. The Aqua ship will be a 110meter luxury vessel featuring an infinity pool, helipad, spa, and gym. It will be completely powered by liquid hydrogen, which means that it will generate water as a byproduct of the electricity that powers the ship. A diesel back-up will be on the boat as hydrogen refueling stations are scarce. The boat will be able to accommodate 14 guests and 31 crew members. It is unlikely to set sail until 2024. Gates regularly rents superyachts but has not previously owned one. He has a strong interest in alternative fuels and has pledged to donate most of his $118 billion fortune to good causes.</p> <br><br>

Starlink has already launched 240 satellites and plans to launch up to another 1,440 satellites this year. These satellites are designed to beam down broadband internet coverage all over the world. Elon Musk is known for hating publicly traded companies and has said in the past that SpaceX won't be going public until its Mars vehicle is complete. SpaceX has recently been valued at around $33.3 billion. The revenue from Starlink will help fund SpaceX's plans to send people to the Moon and Mars. Those in the astronomy community have criticized broadband satellite projects as the resulting constellation could obstruct their observations of the night sky.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F6%2F21126118%2Fhuawei-xiaomi-vivo-oppo-app-store-platform-google-play-dominance-worldwide/1/010001701f5b71de-55cd3812-5f7f-40f4-8973-e66a29bec60b-000000/7KWarH6kq9zc_eNTN81MnEdQw9vl36Di-EH3XycHwQ8=127" target="_blank">China‚Äôs smartphone giants reportedly unite to challenge Google‚Äôs Play Store (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Android users with Chinese-made smartphones have had to download their apps through a variety of different app stores since the Google Play store was banned in China. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo have joined together to create a platform where developers can upload and distribute their apps to all the different stores simultaneously. The Global Developer Service Alliance appears to be an attempt to challenge the Google Play Store's near-monopoly. Together, these companies control over 40 percent of worldwide smartphone shipments.

Participants in the study will be connected to an electroencephalogram so that their brain activity can be recorded and then processed using machine learning algorithms. The aim of the project is to create an AI that can improve coordination between large teams of autonomous air and ground robots. Swarm intelligence is a branch of computer science that deals with collective, decentralized, and self-organized systems, both virtual and robotic. Many applications can be completed with swarms of cheaper robots rather than using single expensive robots. By using a swarm of robots that are all trained to complete different tasks, the group can coordinate and complete many different tasks. It is difficult to train many different robots in a wide range of tasks. The scientists hope that they will be able to speed up the process by studying brain activity when making decisions.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fa30784690%2Fchernobyl-fungus%2F%3Futm_source=reddit.com/1/010001701f5b71de-55cd3812-5f7f-40f4-8973-e66a29bec60b-000000/qHWQH-x-Mz55NEBlzc-DhbU24n5wwLHvfG3o6UF2fks=127" target="_blank">You Should Know About This Chernobyl Fungus That Eats Radiation (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A fungus that can eat radiation was found in Chernobyl in 2007. The fungus grows towards the hottest and most radioactive places. It contains a lot of dark melanin pigment, which absorbs radiation and processes it in a harmless way to produce energy. Scientists believe that the mechanism can be mimicked to create materials that block radiation and generate renewable energy. This kind of material would be helpful in creating more effective protective suits, as well as coverings for radioactive machinery. NASA plans to send the fungus into space as growing it in space could reveal new information about the species.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid=22255301/1/010001701f5b71de-55cd3812-5f7f-40f4-8973-e66a29bec60b-000000/1bkusZOf28nChlObIqrxBy59xKzXMGukSbEVxtsaqmk=127" target="_blank">Ask HN: Advice for a new and inexperienced tech lead?

Good communication between the team is key to making sure everything is running smoothly. The role involves a lot of social ability, not just tech expertise, as it is more about being a good leader than a good developer.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmint-lang%2Fmint/1/010001701f5b71de-55cd3812-5f7f-40f4-8973-e66a29bec60b-000000/qyo0NbZPV5RSpPdeHu-TtPAXqvVJ81l4O0evFOotLuA=127" target="_blank">Mint (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Mint is a programming language for front-end web development.

So far, the coronavirus has killed 636 people and infected 31,161 people in mainland China. The virus causes severe respiratory infection, starting with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people are likely to fully recover from the illness. Dr. Li made a post on Weibo after noticing seven cases of a virus that was similar to SARS. He was investigated by local authorities for spreading rumors and was accused of making false statements that had 'severely disturbed the social order'. Chinese social media has responded to Li's death by flooding social media with calls for the government to apologize for its treatment of Li, as well as for the right to freedom of speech. These posts were quickly censored. Many posts still discuss the topic indirectly, indicating the growing amount of anger and distrust towards the Chinese government. China has imposed heavy restrictions on its population in an attempt to control the virus.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F6%2F21122335%2Fnintendo-mario-paint-music-composers-snes/1/010001701f5b71de-55cd3812-5f7f-40f4-8973-e66a29bec60b-000000/DS74YGhR_fYUVlpCo4Mix_AZCXHHR7VVxeA9OTW3XAE=127" target="_blank">Meet the musicians who compose in Mario Paint (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">'Mario Paint Composer' is a genre that you can search for on YouTube. Using Mario Paint to create songs involves having to use a very unusual set of in-game tools. Starting in 2013, the trend has now evolved so that most composers aren't even using the original music maker anymore. Instead, they are using a custom program that mimics Mario Paint's compositional capabilities with a few extra features added. Early players had to find creative methods to create specific sounds in the original game. The trend died down soon after it began, and most videos and resources are old. There are still small, active Mario Paint communities on Discord. Members of the community feel that the restrictions that the game imposes on its players force them to be more creative, making composing songs inside the game fun and challenging.</p> <br><br>

SpaceX is offering rideshare services for $1 million per payload ranging up to 200kg, with an additional $5 per extra kilogram of cargo. Customers can select the desired orbit and the launch date, input the total amount and size of cargo, and select a specific rocket to book a ride on. The website will return an estimated cost. Customers can then choose some extra options, such as insurance. A small deposit is required, after which the customers can pay the rest of the fee in up to three installments. A Rideshare User's Guide has been released by SpaceX that contains more details about the program.

Simmons and his employees will all be absorbed in the deal. The Ringer has around 30 titles, ranging from an NBA chat show to a show devoted to rewatching old movies. Neither company disclosed a sale price for the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of this year. Spotify did not make Gimlet Media's podcasts exclusive to its platform when it purchased the company last year, so The Ringer's podcasts should still be available on all platforms.

The result was a clear 4K video that played at 60 frames per second. AI has been a hot topic in recent years, with the technology being applied to create technology such as autonomous cars. Denis Shiryaev used a mix of neural networks from Gigapixel AI and a technique called depth-aware video frame interpolation to improve the quality of the old video. The Gigapixel AI was trained to 'fill in' information in an image to upscale it and improve its quality. It is possible that the AI could introduce erroneous details, and it is much slower than conventional techniques. The network can be trained to colorize images and add in various missing patterns in objects like floors, windows, and vegetation. Some data scientists are attempting to create neural networks that can draw and paint. AI is getting so big that large tech companies are all racing to buy or invest in every new and obscure startup in the field.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.extremetech.com%2Fextreme%2F305724-researchers-say-anti-solar-panels-could-generate-power-at-night/1/010001701a361f70-b64d3cff-dee7-447d-a929-906df4a2ee60-000000/qtV0J-LhkglPrkegIL4TWQMEuLe9vR9Dh_Cm5SucEvY=127" target="_blank">Researchers Say ‚ÄòAnti-Solar Panels‚Äô Could Generate Power at Night (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Researchers from the University of California have designed 'anti-solar panels' which would theoretically be able to generate solar power at night. Solar panels work because they are cold compared to the sun, so they absorb sunlight and convert it into energy. The anti-solar panels reverse the process and generate energy through the loss of energy from the panels to the cool night sky. It is estimated that the panels would be able to generate about a quarter of the power of a solar panel. The next step for the scientists is to build the devices to see how well they perform. It may be possible to boost the efficiency of the cells by using materials that can better interact with longer wavelengths of light.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Falexpareto.com%2Fscalability%2Fsystems%2F2020%2F02%2F03%2Fscaling-100k.html/1/010001701a361f70-b64d3cff-dee7-447d-a929-906df4a2ee60-000000/OBW9l-mro_xUuAM_qxA_M80KjwTULWIbvy651bv56PA=127" target="_blank">Scaling to 100k Users (8 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">As startups grow, they will inevitably have to deal with issues of scale. This can be a good problem, but there is scarce information on how to scale web apps as the number of users grows to hundreds of thousands. Developments usually come from dealing with massive issues or identifying bottlenecks. As a web app grows, it will have different needs. Infrastructure is built and changed incrementally. Larger web apps will start needing services like load balancers and CDNs. As businesses continue to grow, developers will always need to continue to work to solve problems of scale.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fdatascience%2Fcomments%2Feytza6%2Fexperienced_data_scientists_what_are_the_most%2F/1/010001701a361f70-b64d3cff-dee7-447d-a929-906df4a2ee60-000000/bsMhj0Mh5RF-UBnFoeg1_eUVb1uStmKI9E0Ay51G0aA=127" target="_blank">Experienced data scientists, what are the most common issues you see newly graduated students have when they start working for the first time?

It is important to validate the results that are generated from machines as the models aren't always correct and they may make the wrong predictions. A good data scientist is critical of their own work and will seek to find out where they might have gone wrong. Newer data scientists should learn how to estimate processing times, follow basic coding practices, learn how to say 'no' especially if the task is impossible, value product knowledge, learn the industry, and learn from others in the industry. If a data scientist is unfamiliar with the business they are working for, the results and predictions they generate may be useless for their company.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.protocol.com%2Fsilicon-valley-tech-shuttles/1/010001701a361f70-b64d3cff-dee7-447d-a929-906df4a2ee60-000000/i97ZMfkAO9iw7QMS1MsnciojDmaFrPpeeY3OxZuQCno=127" target="_blank">Extreme Silicon Valley: A 2:30 a.m. bus from Salida (8 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Tech companies are operating shuttle buses that go all the way to the Central Valley as more and more tech employees move into the area. When tech companies first started offering shuttle buses for their employees more than a decade ago, these buses were focused in affluent neighborhoods. Now they reach much further into city outskirts. Housing prices have risen sharply where tech companies are based. Anti-development politics in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and the East Bay make it hard to build new housing and improve public transit systems.

Prior to the election, the party had kept the app developer's identity secret for security purposes. It has now been revealed that the app was developed by a startup called Shadow, which has also previously provided services to the Texas Democratic Party, Kirsten Gillibrand's primary bid, and Pete Buttigieg's campaign. Shadow's parent company, Acronym, has stated that they only invested in the company and that they don't know the specifics of the app failure. The app was never vetted by major cybersecurity agencies or the wider cybersecurity community. Many of the specifics of the app are still kept secret, which is a cause for concern according to security experts.</p> <br><br>

Google says that the issue has now been resolved and only affected less than 0.01% of users who were using the Takeouts service.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F4%2F21122982%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-leaked-images-led-case-winfuture/1/01000170150e9258-e18601a2-7c65-49c9-8a9d-f956cd444731-000000/AuzLZNB99XivttAiwcee7wKoZLMb0vFcAstW97FkhAA=126" target="_blank">Samsung leaks images of its new Galaxy S20 (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Samsung accidentally revealed the Galaxy S20 through a set of marketing images posted on one of Samsung's online stores in a European country. The posts were quickly removed but they confirmed a few details about the new phone, including its Galaxy S20 name, a hole-punch selfie camera, and a tall camera bump. A new gray case with LEDs similar to the LED case for the Galaxy S10 was also included in the leak. Samsung's Unpacked event is on February 11 and it is expected that Samsung will be revealing three variants of the S20 and a new vertically folding phone.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fscitechdaily.com%2Fhandheld-bioprinter-treats-severe-burns-by-printing-new-skins-cells-directly-onto-wound%2F/1/01000170150e9258-e18601a2-7c65-49c9-8a9d-f956cd444731-000000/qn6qjPvy4ixtDaTgZRogJz3Mzl_tF2-BTadhlLhN0Wk=126" target="_blank">Handheld Bioprinter Treats Severe Burns by ‚ÄòPrinting‚Äô New Skins Cells Directly Onto Wound (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Canadian researchers have successfully trialed a handheld 3D skin printer that treats severe burns by printing new skin cells directly onto a wound. The printer provides a method of treatment for patients whose injuries are too extensive for skin grafts. It uses a bioink based on the protein involved with clotting and cells that support the growth of other cells and assist in the body's immune response. The device is able to deploy skin sheets onto wounds uniformly, safely, and reliably all over the body. Patients who were treated with the device healed extremely well, with a reduction in inflammation, scarring, and contraction compared to other treatments.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fspectrum.ieee.org%2Ftech-talk%2Fconsumer-electronics%2Fgadgets%2Fbosch-ar-smartglasses-tiny-eyeball-lasers/1/01000170150e9258-e18601a2-7c65-49c9-8a9d-f956cd444731-000000/T_0Po0DPCboMQCLKeYky6yUWchCcymET_Mj7BwxnjTc=126" target="_blank">Bosch Gets Smartglasses Right With Tiny Eyeball Lasers (7 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A few weeks before CES, Bosch released a concept video of its new Smartglasses prototype. The three-minute video is linked in the article. In the video, people are shown wearing glasses with a completely transparent display. It shows people viewing notifications and messages and also interacting with the display by tapping on the arms of the glasses. The Smartglasses require custom fitting as they work by firing colored lasers directly on the retina to create images. It only takes a few minutes to fit the glasses, and they can be repositioned slightly without the image disappearing. As the image is projected directly onto the retina, it is always in focus, although it will disappear if the user looks to the side. This can feel weird to the user as there is no depth to the image. Observers will not be able to tell when the display is active as only the user can see the projected display.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid=22235279/1/01000170150e9258-e18601a2-7c65-49c9-8a9d-f956cd444731-000000/lTqK_AwxFPIsoUbY4Tx6lWMKgJLT64_2dGBG61x-mXk=126" target="_blank">Ask HN: What Skills to Acquire in 2020?

Contract cheating has become a lucrative business in Kenya in recent years. Kenya is where most academic writers are based, according to researchers. People in Kenya are incredibly qualified with very high levels of English and they are able to write high quality essays quickly. Students can bypass anti-plagiarism software by contracting off their assignment work. The global contract cheating industry is worth more than $1 billion, with writers in Kenya only seeing a small share of it as businesses take most of the money. Some countries, such as Australia, and many states in the US, have implemented legislation against contract cheating, and governments have urged PayPal and Google to lock payments and advertisements for contract cheating websites. This hasn't done much to slow down the industry. It will exist as long as writers need money and students need to pass assignments to earn degrees.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F02%2F04%2Fiowa-caucus-app-debacle-is-one-of-the-most-stunning-it-failures-ever.html/1/01000170150e9258-e18601a2-7c65-49c9-8a9d-f956cd444731-000000/YtWBfHDCGDgYV8GanFopuamA8QTPi0gbFiLa5z80lBg=126" target="_blank">Iowa caucus debacle is one of the most stunning tech failures ever (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Iowa Democratic Party officials found irregularities in the data collected by its caucusing app during the recent elections, causing them to switch from the app to counting votes manually. The Iowa Democrats were using an app made by a startup named Shadow Inc, which is managed by a nonprofit investment company called Acronym. According to the party, the issue only affected reporting and did not affect how accurate the data was. The Iowa Democratic Party used an application made by Microsoft in 2016 and the reason they chose to switch to using the untested startup's app is unclear. In August, the Democratic National Committee had recommended Iowa stop using an app altogether. The fact that it has taken so much time for the party to recover from the coding issue shows how unprepared they would have been in the event of an actual cyberattack.</p> <br><br>

It uses audio from the Apollo 11 mission combined with a collage of images of various moon motifs from pop culture to create a dream-like experience. The mammalian diving response is triggered when people are submerged in cool or cold water. This response causes lower heart-rate and the blood vessels in the extremities to constrict. It also appears to be able to reliably stop VR users from getting nauseous. Being underwater also helps block out distracting sounds, creating a very immersive experience.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fteivah%2Falgodeck/1/010001700fe87543-37497671-5383-4902-a81d-597cc925887b-000000/fLDo0olhbXTbpR_xPLG3YpbBJwupDxRaWNZfHj_16b0=126" target="_blank">Algo Deck (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Algo Deck is an open-source collection of over 200 algorithmic flash cards.

When you work at a company, they want to pay you as little as possible, which is fairly common across all industries. Companies will pay more to keep employees from leaving, and employees negotiate salaries to negate the risks of getting fired, going broke, or having to work for a FAANG company. Employees can use their demand with other companies to raise salaries as employers try to reduce the risk of them leaving. Even the hint of a chance of a job opportunity from a FAANG company can usually keep employers on their toes. If all high-paying companies suddenly stopped hiring, the asking salary of many developers with other companies would drop significantly. The success of big tech companies has a huge effect on the salary of all workers in the industry.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fmobile.twitter.com%2Felonmusk%2Fstatus%2F1224087317364854785/1/010001700fe87543-37497671-5383-4902-a81d-597cc925887b-000000/FZz42-rm_KDbB9j78sWjF6JQ6BwUEIV1_bQ3IN6-P4I=126" target="_blank">Elon Musk - Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house (Twitter Thread)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Elon Musk has tweeted that Tesla will be holding an AI party/hackathon at his house in about four weeks.

Most of Instacart's workforce are independent contractors, but around 12,000 workers are legally employees. Instacart has stated that it supports the action of its workers. Workers at Instacart do not receive healthcare and other benefits as their work hours are capped at 29 hours a week. The tech industry has seen unprecedented levels of organization amongst its workers recently. In the last few months, many companies have experienced worker-led strikes, protests, and online boycotts. The victory sends a message to other gig workers around the country who are fed up with working conditions at Silicon Valley tech companies.</p> <br><br>

Sometimes known as Mexican walking fish, axolotls are able to regenerate entire body parts if they go missing. Other salamanders are able to regenerate limbs, but the axolotl is also able to regenerate organs, including parts of the eyes, brain, and heart. The axolotl genome, which is about 10 times larger than the human genome, was sequenced in 2018. Last year, scientists identified and mapped structures within the genome, and in the process identified two genes that were involved in the axolotl's tissue regeneration. The research is still in its infancy and there may be more genes still involved in regeneration. Scientists hope to be able to find ways to one day enable humans to replicate the axolotl's regenerative abilities.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2Fs%2F615113%2Fthese-are-the-highest-resolution-photos-of-the-sun-ever-taken%2F/1/0100016ffb4e2976-a4adb2e5-5417-421a-8898-2042df00e908-000000/JMB5Il8kdYMnEizEVfITzCB0buvYWWpoU17vR_XTffw=126" target="_blank">This is the highest-resolution photo of the sun ever taken (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The highest-resolution ever image of the sun, taken by the Daniel K.

It can observe structures on the sun as small as 18.5 miles. The telescope is still under construction, and in the next six months, it will have the capability to record temperature, velocity, and solar structures. DKIST has one of the world's most complex solar-adaptive optic systems. It uses deformable mirrors that adjust 2,000 times per second to offset distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. A swimming pool of ice and 7.5 miles of pipe-distributed coolant is used to cool down the telescope during operation.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsam-hosseini%2Ffreelancing-in-finland/1/0100016ffb4e2976-a4adb2e5-5417-421a-8898-2042df00e908-000000/cizezZMh8aBSWw1VncTZRt1xZYK3I-V2H4yBhLCFaf8=126" target="_blank">Freelancing in Finland (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">In Finland, most information provided by authorities regarding freelancing is for the general population, and specific information for developers is sparse.

The social media giant has been criticized in the past for its attempts to appease people, leading to some positive but shallow sentiment toward the company. Zuckerberg says that Facebook is committed to being more clear about its principles, such as freedom of expression, encryption, and targeted advertising. He believes that in order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for. While Facebook's values might not always be popular, Zuckerberg believes that Facebook's focus will open these topics up to more discussion. Zuckerberg has been having dinners with political figures from across the spectrum on a lot of different issues.

While Apple ended up as third for the year, it beat out Samsung in the last quarter due to its iPhone 11 sales. Samsung will be launching its flagship Galaxy S20 series next month, and Apple is set to launch its successor to the iPhone SE soon. Overall, the industry sold fewer phones in 2019 than it did in 2018.</p> <br><br>

The information harvested includes location, financial, and message data. Unless Apple complies with the regulation, which kicks in during July 2020, it will have to pull out of Russia. The law is part of Vladimir Putin's goal to create a sovereign internet. Apple has yet to release a statement about the changes. Making these changes would go against Apple's principle of honoring user privacy over the interest of federal governments. Its position on privacy has landed the company in trouble with the US government in the past. Preloaded apps would pose just as real a threat as an official backdoor. Apple has recently changed Ukraine to be part of Russia in its weather reporting, a move that was heavily criticized on Ukrainian social media. The choices that Apple faces highlight the increasing power that large tech companies' decisions have on geopolitics.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2F2020%2F01%2F28%2Fmeena-is-googles-attempt-at-making-true-conversational-ai%2F/1/0100016ff62728db-6662ccfa-e5a9-45be-9c7f-aa8b48831b5d-000000/6shvFdL3EVFwEQ-WYdjnAA-p0Ge8nAmmgq_MHVDVdtk=126" target="_blank">Meena is Google‚Äôs attempt at making true conversational AI (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Conversational AI is a term for AI that can interpret human words, speak to people, or carry out tasks or computations with natural language. The best-known AI assistants today are not exactly conversational. Google has revealed Meena, a conversational neural network with 2.6 billion parameters that can handle multiturn dialogue. Google developed a Sensibleness and Specificity Average metric to measure the ability of a conversational agent to maintain responses in a conversation that make sense and are specific. Humans rank around 86 percent on the SSA, and Meena scores around 79 percent.

The three-fingered machine has pressurized reservoirs filled with water inside its fingers which are connected to the surface via ducts made of heat-reactive plastic. When the plastic reaches a certain temperature, the pores open and water is released onto the surface, evaporating and cooling the machine down. Most robots are made of metal, which is good at dispersing heat, but soft robots designed for delicate tasks like medical procedures and packing fruit are made from rubber, which is a good insulator. One of the downsides to sweating is that it reduces friction, which could be an issue for gripping-type robots. There are GIFs in the article showing the sweating robot in action.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.sciencealert.com%2Fresearchers-transplant-lab-grown-heart-muscles-for-the-first-time/1/0100016ff62728db-6662ccfa-e5a9-45be-9c7f-aa8b48831b5d-000000/zZ1ep_q72N1XNAyyCBuP-myoR6Aa8nygTb--vLJF4hk=126" target="_blank">Lab-Grown Heart Muscles Have Been Transplanted Into a Human For The First Time (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Researchers in Japan have performed the first lab-grown muscle transplant. Degradable sheets containing lab-grown heart muscle cells were placed on areas with damaged heart muscle cells in a patient. The heart muscle cells were grown from induced pluripotent stem cells. If the patient from the study responds well to the treatment, the researchers plan to perform the same procedure on nine other people within the next three years. All of these patients suffer from a condition that requires a heart transplant in severe cases. This technique could be the much-needed alternative to heart transplants as finding suitable heart donors is difficult and transplanted organs have a much higher risk of rejection by the patient's immune system.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwillmcgugan%2Frich/1/0100016ff62728db-6662ccfa-e5a9-45be-9c7f-aa8b48831b5d-000000/G6lZts4WMLqDxLYKFu_QzkIh5uuvRje81SPFfLriOAM=126" target="_blank">Rich (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Rich is a Python library that creates rich text and formatting in the terminal.

Gundam first aired in 1979, leaving an indelible mark on Japanese culture and the world of animation. Sales of Gundam miniature figurines approached half a billion back in 2015. This is the fourth full-size Gundam attraction that designer Masaki Kawahara has worked on. The robot will weigh around 25 tons and have 24 degrees of motion. Building the robot will stretch the limits of common motor, materials, and actuator technologies. It will be developed using the open-source Robot Operating System and Gazebo simulation software. A full-scale virtual copy of the robot will be released so that aspiring programmers can play with it and develop their own actions and poses.

The guests were passengers from a flight to Hangzhou from Singapore. They were quarantined after two passengers were found with a fever. As of Wednesday, the coronavirus has killed 132 people in China and infected nearly 6,000 people worldwide.</p> <br><br>

It credited its services, wearables, and its newest iPhones for the performance. There are now over 1.6 billion Apple devices actively used around the world. Apple had warned investors that its first-quarter revenue for 2019 would be weaker than expected due to lower demand from China. Since then, Apple stock has more than doubled. Apple no longer publishes unit sales for its devices, but it is estimated that iPhone revenue was worth $55.96 billion and AirPods sales were worth about $6 billion. Services were worth around $12.7 billion to the tech giant. While Apple did not publish Apple TV Plus subscriber numbers, Tim Cook has noted that the service was off to a rousing start. Apple sold around $10 billion worth of wearables in the quarter. The recent coronavirus outbreak has caused Apple and other retailers to close their stores, affecting potential earnings for this quarter.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeednews.com%2Farticle%2Falexkantrowitz%2Fproduct-hunt-has-released-yourstack-a-social-network-where/1/0100016ff102cc72-7f19f73b-9bba-4aaa-84b8-d7362c4bc87e-000000/vR02PZ_AVfiFKmw1wZzQNSJ4JNgTnCqr08bRJ2S_G9s=125" target="_blank">Product Hunt Has Released YourStack, A Social Network Where People Talk About Products (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">YourStack is a new social network that is focused on products that friends and public figures recommend.

Smart camera networks are an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties around the world. In the past, surveillance technology produced low-quality images and required a lot of hours and physical work to search through to find information. With advances in technology, image quality has improved, and image recognition and video analysis capabilities allow us to search through and extract more data from video faster than ever before. Advances in machine learning mean that we are moving towards the possibility of predictive policing, where data can be used to predict crimes so that police can intervene before it happens.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fscience-environment-51097309/1/0100016ff102cc72-7f19f73b-9bba-4aaa-84b8-d7362c4bc87e-000000/XGKuSExgAwAM5E7k0qgbwiO5tok4BnX9GoFhEpmt8bo=125" target="_blank">Antarctica melting: Climate change and the journey to the 'doomsday glacier' (11 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Icefin is a remotely operated robot submarine. It was sent to investigate an area where the Thwaites glacier meets warm ocean water, causing it to start melting. The Thwaites glacier is roughly the size of Britain and currently accounts for four percent of the world sea-level rise each year. Satellite data shows that it is melting increasingly rapidly, and it could eventually raise the world sea level up by more than half a meter. It takes teams whole weeks to get to the glacier, which makes it difficult to study and understand. Before the Icefin expedition, only four other people, the advance party for the Icefin team, have ever been at the front of the glacier. The ice in Antarctica holds 90 percent of the world's freshwater. Researchers hope to find out what is causing the aggressive melting of the Thwaites by using Icefin to study the water underneath the ice.</p> <br><br>

Musk was seen cruising about Hawthorne, California in a Cybertruck recently. An Instagram user posted a video of an encounter, which Musk then retweeted. The video is a little blurry, but it shows what appears to be Musk driving a Cybertruck. One of the people in the video says 'Jay Leno and Elon'. It is linked in the article. The car taking the video barely comes up to the bottom of the Cybertruck's window.

Using the patterns found in the data they collected, the scientists were able to predict the timing and direction of a fish's movement with brain imaging techniques. Larval zebrafish have much simpler brain systems, so they are the best place to start to look for activity patterns that might be distributed and hard to connect. Brains do not execute the exact same responses every time, even for the same activity. The scientists monitored neural activity simultaneously from about 5,000 individual neurons in the brains of the fish during training. Results from the study suggested that the cerebellum was a major contributor to decision-making, despite its well-known role in motor control.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F01%2F27%2Fnasa-taps-startup-axiom-space-for-the-first-habitable-commercial-module-for-the-space-station%2F/1/0100016febdc6e36-14ce7869-3289-407b-a398-94f60b29dd04-000000/KmUfdV7EG47KQwb6lInsH9cOHMtuvgrSZ_9TYtr_2r0=125" target="_blank">NASA taps startup Axiom Space for the first habitable commercial module for the Space Station (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Axiom Space has been selected by NASA to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station.

Programmers have developed their own jargon to communicate with each other which people outside of the programming world might not understand. The simplest explanation that includes the most important information is usually the best. Using jargon to try to demonstrate intelligence and superiority is usually the wrong way to go about conveying an idea. Being respectful to others goes a long way in getting them to want to understand you. Practicing pitching ideas to non-technical friends can help you receive useful feedback. Techniques like analogies, anecdotes, and metaphors are great tools for getting ideas across. It's ok to admit when you don't know something, and it is often better than losing respect for getting something wrong, as long as you take the initiative to self-educate.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnicrusso7%2Frex-gym/1/0100016febdc6e36-14ce7869-3289-407b-a398-94f60b29dd04-000000/F2iiGdOpx70308OabkINM4_EHq-uzwfVjlz9I4cCoq0=125" target="_blank">Rex (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Rex is a project to train an open-source 3D printed quadruped robot.

During this period, it is important to remember that work provides an important level of structure in your life. It provides routine and social contact, and without it, it is easy to slide into bad habits, especially when going through rough periods in life. Finding good medical help is important in recovering from tough life events. Many suggest that if the stress is too much, moving to a less stressful job might be the best choice. However, unless it is financially feasible and it really is the best option, the least advised choice is to become unemployed, unless there is a plan around it. One of the best ways to get through tough periods is to keep yourself busy, so if it is possible, taking time off from work to travel is a good option.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen_us%2Farticle%2Fqjdkq7%2Favast-antivirus-sells-user-browsing-data-investigation/1/0100016febdc6e36-14ce7869-3289-407b-a398-94f60b29dd04-000000/zSMHY0BQ-VQYt9Y8lDYggxH_CKsTIBaXSUZbZRy-XHA=125" target="_blank">Leaked Documents Expose the Secretive Market for Your Web Browsing Data (9 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A subsidiary of the antivirus giant Avast called Jumpshot sold highly sensitive web browsing data to many of the world's biggest companies. Jumpshot says it has data from 100 million devices, which it received from Avast. The data includes Google searches, location lookups and GPS coordinates in Google Maps, and browser history information. Using the data, it is possible to identify individual users and the search terms they used on a wide range of sites, including YouPorn and PornHub. The data doesn't contain users' names, but there is enough specific browsing data to deanonymize certain users. Avast collected the data via a browser plugin designed to warn users of suspicious websites. It claimed to have stopped sending customer data to Jumpshot after the data collection was publicly exposed in 2015, but documents indicate that the data collection is still ongoing through the antivirus software itself. Jumpshot sells a variety of different products based on the data.</p> <br><br>

Environmentalists are still divided over nuclear power, with some saying that it is dangerous and expensive, and others saying that it is necessary to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The mini reactors will be able to compete on price with low-cost renewables such as offshore wind. Rolls-Royce plans to build 10 to 15 of the 1.5-acre power stations at former nuclear sites in Cumbria or Wales. Theoretically, every town could have its own reactor, but using existing sites avoids having to secure towns against terrorist attacks. Some experts criticize Rolls-Royce's plan to produce power plants via an assembly line as production line mistakes could lead to defects that propagate throughout an entire fleet of reactors.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Finformation-technology%2F2020%2F01%2Fdirectv-races-to-decommission-broken-boeing-satellite-before-it-explodes%2F/1/0100016fe6b5d821-e3ea89b5-2976-405d-8f9e-04a149d0f322-000000/EHTHlnFMWMN25jPFmZQagWHoiuiHmf-cAzLbO5ttSqM=125" target="_blank">DirecTV races to decommission broken Boeing satellite before it explodes (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">DirecTV has asked the Federal Communications Commission for a rules waiver so it can move a broken Boeing satellite out of its standard orbit in order to limit the risk of an accidental explosion. The 15-year-old Spaceway-1 satellite is at risk of explosion due to damage to its batteries. DirecTV has already disabled the satellite's primary function. The satellite can still operate on power reserves from its solar panels, but not during the upcoming eclipse season starting at the end of February. Satellites usually discharge all of its fuel prior to being taken out of their normal orbits, but this isn't possible due to the explosion risk. Spaceway-1 will be moved to a graveyard orbit 300km above the geostationary arc.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmiragejs%2Fmiragejs/1/0100016fe6b5d821-e3ea89b5-2976-405d-8f9e-04a149d0f322-000000/JoOAXkxo02HJV-i7S2T5ADmNAfDpDB4WUTi1ro7dei4=125" target="_blank">Mirage JS (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Mirage JS is an API mocking library to develop, test, and prototype JavaScript apps without requiring any backend services.

Chef Garden is available for purchase by the public, but Samsung has not yet released retail pricing.

Researchers have created a 3D-printed reproduction of Nesyamun's over 3,000-year-old vocal tract to hear what his voice would have sounded like. A team from the University of London took a series of CT scans of Nesyamun's mummified body to create the 3D model. Some parts, such as the tongue that had shriveled, were virtually filled in. The model was attached to an electronic larynx and loudspeaker. Using this method, the team recreated the sound of Nesayamun's voice.

Most of those who have died of the virus were 60 or older, and all have been in China. The CDC has said that the risk of the virus to the American public is low.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F1%2F23%2F21078310%2Fgoogle-dataset-search-beta-over-filters-improved-open-source/1/0100016fd74a77f4-0d81254e-8523-429b-afe1-fccbdca5d65e-000000/jMkeOr_YD2B9Z04lPeqQuWEdnZ2RoXO-2rg9bSL2B0k=125" target="_blank">Google‚Äôs search engine for scientists upgraded for better data scouring (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Dataset Search is now out of beta, containing almost 25 million datasets on a wide range of information.

It recently announced a licensing deal with Merlin, a global agency that represents hundreds of thousands of artists, to use the labels' music legally on TikTok anywhere that the app is available. TikTok has secured deals with other major labels but has been restricted from going public on the details. The licensing deal with Merlin covers TikTok's upcoming music subscription service, Resso. Resso was first spotted in the wild as a test app in India and Indonesia. Despite being one of the most popular apps, TikTok still struggles to gain revenue, and a music streaming app is one way for it to generate revenue. It has been working on ways to become independent from China as it continues to face regulatory scrutiny for its acquisition by ByteDance.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fsfist.com%2F2020%2F01%2F23%2Finstagram-chief-adam-mosseris-sf-home-got-swatted%2F/1/0100016fd74a77f4-0d81254e-8523-429b-afe1-fccbdca5d65e-000000/S8U6U3Vh8y9YLrWuEg8vb2vsSvnqfd9Z3bA18EelDGs=125" target="_blank">Instagram Chief Adam Mosseri's SF Home Got Swatted (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Facebook's head of Instagram Adam Mosseri had both his homes swatted in November. These retaliatory attacks are spawned by anonymous trolls on dark-web forums. Authorities in New York City and San Francisco received multiple reports that people were being held hostage inside Mosseri's homes, resulting in hours-long standoffs at both locations, twice. Similar attacks involving other tech executives have happened around the Bay Area and Seattle in the last couple of years. Seattle has launched a registry for potential swatting victims. People who have signed up for the registry will receive a phone call by the police if they are reported to be involved in hostage situations or something similar. There are currently no federal laws against swatting, and attacks can be launched anonymously without much fear of getting caught. A swatting incident in 2017 left a 28-year-old man dead after he was shot by a policeman.</p> <br><br>

These experimental apps are part of its Digital Wellbeing initiative. Envelope transforms users' phones so that they can only perform simple, specific functions. For example, users can choose to only be able to make and receive calls through a basic keypad interface, or to only be able to take photos or record video. Users can print out specially designed paper cases that help limit the function of their phones. Envelope is open-sourced on GitHub, so developers can alter the app if they want. Envelope is currently only designed for use with Pixel 3A devices. Activity Bubbles and Stopwatch are both apps that change users' home screens so that they can monitor their usage. Activity Bubbles creates bubbles on the phone background, with bigger bubbles indicating more time spent on the phone, and Stopwatch displays a timer for how long a phone has been unlocked.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fforeignpolicy.com%2F2020%2F01%2F20%2Fwuhan-quarantine-virus-china-coverup-government-how-scared-should-you-be-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus%2F/1/0100016fd221b838-ea8ea033-fc0d-487b-b104-8f251b736ec0-000000/ES6idkHOyMiAhH3RY1oRxUuY8Rj-6Pp4ZHUkdpSXq6A=125" target="_blank">Wuhan‚Äôs 11 Million People Face Quarantine as Virus Fears Spread (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Wuhan, China's seventh-largest city, with approximately 11 million people, will be under a partial quarantine starting on Thursday. All transport from the city has been canceled due to the coronavirus that originated from the city. 17 people have been killed by the virus so far, which was first reported on December 31. The World Health Organization is convening on an emergency meeting regarding the coronavirus. Cases of coronaviruses infecting humans are more common in China due to close contact with domestic animals and the consumption of wild animals. The SARS epidemic in 2003 killed over 800 people. Information being released by the Chinese government regarding the virus is questionable. Mass migrations due to the Lunar New Year is a major concern as it is a perfect recipe for a worldwide epidemic.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F1%2F22%2F21076806%2Fgoogle-janelia-flyem-fruit-fly-brain-map-hemibrain-connectome/1/0100016fd221b838-ea8ea033-fc0d-487b-b104-8f251b736ec0-000000/4BPxLUi2fmNOgqSx02dv2mozNQe-0QpHd_0mjjjQ3Zg=125" target="_blank">Google publishes largest ever high-resolution map of brain connectivity (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Scientists from Google and the Janelia Research Campus in Virginia have published a 3D model that traces 20 million synapses connecting around 25,000 neurons in the brain of a fruit fly. A milestone in the field of connectomics, the map is the largest high-resolution map of brain connectivity in any animal. Connectomics has yet to produce any major breakthroughs, but it helps link physical parts of the brain to specific behaviors. Some scientists believe that creating connectomes is a waste of resources. The fruit fly connectome was created by processing images using an algorithm. Scientists then spent hundreds of thousands of hours verifying the connectome. Fruit fly brains contain around 100,000 neurons, while human brains contain roughly 86 billion.

It is possible to do work that you are more passionate about. Working on well-known free software means that your name might become more well known, leading to more opportunities. Being famous in the software world is not always positive, as some people may have objections to decisions you have made, and they can be vocal about it. It is difficult to join a community without at least a few people who don't already have preconceptions of who you are.

For every $50 billion rise in Tesla's market cap, Musk receives 1.69 million shares, which is currently worth around $1 billion.

People are building bomb shelters, making survival kits, and creating plans to survive scenarios like a zombie apocalypse, terrorist attacks, or other extreme events. Rich people are getting into doomsday preparation. People can rent speedboats in New York for a $6,000 a month retainer so that they can escape the city should anything happen. In South Dakota, there is a ranch that builds luxury bunkers. In Nebraska, a company teaches the rich self-defense skills. Rich people are more likely to be the targets of certain types of crime. Some wealthy individuals are spending their money on spreading awareness of climate change as their way of preparing for a brighter future. A missile launch center in Kansas was converted into a series of luxury condos that can withstand the shockwave from a nuclear explosion. While these purchases may never be used, they give their owners peace of mind in case anything ever happens.</p> <br><br>

California has recently implemented a new gig work law that changes how independent contractors are classified. The new fare-setting system is part of Uber's plan to continue classifying drivers as independent contractors. Other new changes include drivers receiving more trip information before accepting rides, drivers being able to reject customers without penalties, customers being given estimated prices rather than exact prices upfront, and the ability for customers to select favorite drivers to request them again.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F1%2F21%2F21075647%2Fus-wuhan-coronavirus-case-china-deaths-virus-illness/1/0100016fccf59766-904c5a1e-2d29-4e71-b8ee-e9a7d9e60c4a-000000/pa1THGIW9g2UI3TYloPpj6z2_bnayICutsDsmiOSspw=124" target="_blank">The US has its first case of the new Wuhan coronavirus (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A case of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, has been reported in a patient in Seattle, Washington.

The virus is currently known as 2019-nCoV, and it has killed around six people. Experts are concerned about the virus‚Äôs similarities to SARS. Enhanced health screenings have been put in place at some airports for passengers who flew from or through Wuhan. Coronaviruses are common in animals and can evolve into forms that can be passed to and infect humans. The World Health Organization identified a wholesale food market in Wuhan as the possible source of the virus.

At less than a meter long on average, the sharks are more of a threat to small crustaceans and mollusks than they are to humans. The walking sharks live in the coastal waters around northern Australia and the island of New Guinea.

While Rust has its downsides, it solves pain points present in many other languages, providing a solid step forward. Rust's static typing attempts to stay out of a programmer's way while encouraging long-term maintainability. It gives developers control over memory management, resulting in more efficiency for optimized applications. Rust can be used to write extremely low-level code, such as operating system kernels or microcontroller applications. Developers don't need to focus on tiny details, as Rust tries to have as many zero-cost abstractions as possible.

Bezos and the prince were reportedly having a friendly chat on the app when the video file was sent, resulting in large amounts of data being exfiltrated from Bezos' phone within hours. The move indicates that the prince may have had personal involvement in targeting the world's richest man, raising concerns for westerners looking to invest in Saudi Arabia. A Washington Post journalist was killed five months after the hack, and some of Bezos' intimate details and text messages were published nine months after the hack. Saudi Arabia denies all involvement with the hack or the killing.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT/1/0100016fccf59766-904c5a1e-2d29-4e71-b8ee-e9a7d9e60c4a-000000/_jm_YDc7yr4L8QjGkI4o5bnbortucXoGqwYfcaxqfa0=124" target="_blank">Exclusive: Apple dropped plan for encrypting backups after FBI complained - sources (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Two years ago, Apple dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt iCloud backups after the FBI complained the move would harm investigations. The company did not want to be attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving data out of reach of government agencies, or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption. Last week, US Attorney General William Barr called Apple to unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who had shot and killed three Americans at a Florida naval base last month. President Donald Trump added pressure, accusing Apple of refusing to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers, and other violent criminal elements. Apple had provided the shooter's iCloud backups to law enforcement and rejected accusations that it had not provided substantive assistance. In the first half of last year, Apple provided full device backups or other iCloud content to US authorities for over 6,000 accounts for 1,568 cases. If Apple had continued plans to encrypt iCloud backups, it would not have been able to provide any data.</p> <br><br>

Huawei was able to skirt the US government's trade ban as TomTom is a Netherlands-based company. Its phones are still powered by Android, but they lack Google's apps and services, including the Play Store. This has impacted Huawei's ability to sell its phones outside of Asia. It has been looking for software alternatives just in case it is forced to ditched Android entirely.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Science &amp; Cutting Edge Technology</span><br>Stories about scientific breakthroughs and futuristic technologies like AI, blockchain, and space travel</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fchina%2Fscience%2Farticle%2F3046846%2Fmeet-chinese-robot-worm-could-crawl-your-brain/1/0100016fc7c3f9b9-b0fea2e5-c22c-4d12-8c38-8abc1c87ffb5-000000/oGgkFjasWE89c-3szur54gV2qEzGKO5rQOeR_soIkTg=124" target="_blank">Meet the Chinese robot worm that could crawl into your brain (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Researchers at Shenzhen have created a robot worm that can enter the human body, move along blood vessels, and hook up to neurons. The 1mm by 3mm robotic worm is powered by an external magnetic field generator. It is controlled by changing the magnetic fields around its body. The robot can squeeze through gaps by using infrared radiation to contract its body by more than a third. It can change color due to the hydrogel that it is made from. The robot can be used to deliver drugs to a targeted area, limiting the effects of the drug to the areas where it is needed and reducing the risk of side effects. It could also be used to create a brain-computer interface. It is unlikely that the technology could be used as a weapon as a person needs to lie still in a special environment in order for the robot to be controlled.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fscientists-are-generating-oxygen-from-simulated-moon-du-1841060875/1/0100016fc7c3f9b9-b0fea2e5-c22c-4d12-8c38-8abc1c87ffb5-000000/yb7BjdDRtFVhKxjXx2vdXVeITYrhVzNphQkzCjNE6s0=124" target="_blank">Scientists Are Generating Oxygen from Simulated Moon Dust (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">European scientists are creating a system that will be able to create breathable oxygen from moon dust. Lunar dust, known as regolith, consists of around 40 to 45 percent oxygen. It requires a method called molten salt electrolysis to extract the oxygen. The scientists' prototype is working, but adjustments are still required to make it suitable for use on the Moon. Once the oxygen is extracted, the leftover metals could be transformed into compounds for 3D printing. The resulting system could provide building materials and oxygen for lunar settlers.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhuyenchip.com%2F2020%2F01%2F18%2Ftech-workers-19k-compensation-details.html/1/0100016fc7c3f9b9-b0fea2e5-c22c-4d12-8c38-8abc1c87ffb5-000000/Po6y8-mKFn8sTat-VK6bcb6pEPH0lolVeCIj30AHGi0=124" target="_blank">Analysis of compensation, level, and experience details of 19k tech workers (10 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Data from levels.fyi was analyzed to find out how long it takes on average to become a senior or principal engineer, how much money do tech workers make, whether women get paid less than men in tech, and whether the tech industry favors the young or not. The data for the analysis came from 18.8k tech workers. On average, it takes about 18 years to become a distinguished engineer, and about four years to become a senior software engineer. There are fewer women as the level of career progression increases. Many women leave tech before they are promoted, at more than double the rate of men. The median yearly compensation for tech workers is $195,000 while the mean is $225,000, with very little difference between men and women. Stock grants are a common way to increase total compensation. Tech companies tend to favor younger employees, with older engineers' salaries having no correlation with their years of experience.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftreyhunner.com%2F2019%2F05%2Fpython-builtins-worth-learning%2F/1/0100016fc7c3f9b9-b0fea2e5-c22c-4d12-8c38-8abc1c87ffb5-000000/SC_TzTiRzCXijbSX5CS2W3o3CbnGjci4F83RJuyQALo=124" target="_blank">Python built-ins worth learning (16 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Python has many built-in functions, and it can be difficult to know all of them and how they are used.

The startup already works with Spotify to produce podcast content. Its podcasting business is profitable, which might help provide an instant boost to Spotify's financials. Spotify made a loss of $86 million in 2018, but it turned a profit of about $25 million for the first nine months of 2019.</p> <br><br>

The coronavirus is estimated to have infected around 1,700 people, and two people have died so far. Airports around the world have started screening for passengers originating from Wuhan. While the outbreak is centered in Wuhan, there have been two cases reported in Thailand and one in Japan. 3,400 people a day travel internationally through Wuhan International Airport. Chinese authorities claim that the virus was spread through infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan and that there have been no cases of the virus spreading from one person to another. Understanding how the virus spreads is crucial to assessing its threat. It is unlikely that the virus is only spread through animal exposure. Analysis of the new virus shows that the coronavirus is more related to SARS than any other human coronavirus.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F01%2F15%2Fscience%2Fconstruction-concrete-bacteria-photosynthesis.html%3Faction=click%26module=Editors%2520Picks%26pgtype=Homepage/1/0100016fc2a9059b-a7447ac4-b282-4a13-8fc0-caa966e69d1a-000000/5daEOTyO9BZl3S555t_1semKFNELqPSuUUcj8PZAZUo=124" target="_blank">Bricks Alive! Scientists Create Living Concrete (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A team of researchers at the University of Colorado has developed a kind of concrete that is alive and can reproduce. The minerals in the new concrete are deposited by cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria that can capture energy through photosynthesis. Regular concrete releases a lot of carbon dioxide, but the new concrete is able to absorb the greenhouse gas. The presence of the bacteria gives the concrete a green color, which fades as the material dries. Early attempts at getting the bacteria to create concrete were slow. The scientists discovered that the bacteria could be grown on gelatin, resulting in concrete blocks quickly forming in the shape of whatever mold was used. They remain alive even after a few weeks. A block can be used to spawn more generations of blocks. The bacteria is not picky about the type of sand used, and it can digest waste materials like ground glass or recycled concrete.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjustinamiller%2FSoftwareArchitect/1/0100016fc2a9059b-a7447ac4-b282-4a13-8fc0-caa966e69d1a-000000/P823icVvI4EvixXRKuAYbk-77K8beIrqTGLBEjR8eCQ=124" target="_blank">Become a Better Software Architect (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">A software architect is a software expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards. Software architecture is the fundamental organization of a system and the principles that determine the design and evolution of the system. There are three levels of architecture: application level, solution level, and enterprise level. A software architect needs to be able to design software, make decisions regarding projects, simplify problems and solutions, code, write clear documentation, communicate with others, estimate and evaluate time and skills required for projects, balance the needs of a project, consult with others, and market their own ideas. A roadmap for professional development in software architecture is provided.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftheonedev%2Fonedev/1/0100016fc2a9059b-a7447ac4-b282-4a13-8fc0-caa966e69d1a-000000/LZP3AxVG0nxdM_9WwB1DqYHotDNUDUArFG130nJIUMI=124" target="_blank">OneDev (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">OneDev is an all-in-one DevOps platform that features issue tracking, git management, pull requests, and build farms.

As giants like Facebook and Google become more profit-driven, lowering the quality of user experience as a result, the field is ripe for competitors to join the market. Software development is becoming simpler and more easily accessible, and new types of software will need to be developed as the industry evolves. Some software has already been banned in countries due to political reasons, and this is likely to become a larger issue in the future. Privacy is an increasingly growing sector, but adoption is still slow. AI is on the rise, and it is beginning to be able to complete more and more complicated tasks. Radio technology is becoming cheaper and more accessible, with new types of detection technology currently being developed. The office is changing, with remote teams becoming common.

New nanoparticles have been developed that work like Trojan horses, sneaking ions into cancer cells and causing them to die. The nanoparticles also show potential as a vaccine to guard against recurrence. Cancer cells are vulnerable to sodium ions, but their cell membranes are able to ensure that excess sodium ions are kept outside of the cell. The nanoparticles are able to disguise sodium ions so that they can pass the cell membranes undetected. Once inside the cells, the sodium and chloride ions cause the cell membrane to rupture, inducing cell death and triggering an immune response in the body to fight off other pathogens. The nanoparticles turn into salt once they degrade. In a mice study, the nanoparticles were able to suppress tumor growth by 66 percent compared to a control group, without any side effects to major organs.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgogf%2Fgf/1/0100016fb33633b1-d3341440-514b-4c41-bda3-9b40857df75e-000000/fYZZKdeDXLcPyLO0ScrvKPBfLgRPbpFdE_PTMmVfxFE=124" target="_blank">GoFrame (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">GoFrame is an application development framework for Golang.

The company is reportedly preparing for an IPO and has been valued at $12.6 billion. DoorDash was criticized last year for its controversial pay model, which included tips into delivery drivers' minimum payouts. It changed the pay model in September, and now workers are paid a minimum of $2 per delivery job and tips are paid on top of the calculated pay. How DoorDash calculates how much it pays workers per order is still unknown. It still presents the value of each listed job as a combined amount, obfuscating the amount that customers are actually tipping. DoorDash claims that workers earn an average of $18.54 per active hour on their platform, but do not specify how much of this amount is through tips. An independent analysis found that DoorDash workers may be working for as low as $1.45 per hour, with some jobs actually costing workers money after accounting for basic expenses.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F01%2F15%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fturkey-wikipedia-access-restored.html/1/0100016fb33633b1-d3341440-514b-4c41-bda3-9b40857df75e-000000/73P9cn_LYfivQsIGy5x3aMlBLHRRjimOJ4udRrh0xtY=124" target="_blank">Turkey Restores Wikipedia After More Than 2-Year Ban (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The Turkish government has lifted a two-and-a-half-year ban on Wikipedia after the country's top court ruled that blocking it was unconstitutional.

Free expression is protected in Turkey's constitution. Turkey has tried to block YouTube and Twitter previously, but this was also deemed unconstitutional. The rights of people in Turkey have been under increasing pressure since a failed coup in 2016. Tens of thousands of websites are still blocked, and 47 journalists remain jailed.</p> <br><br>

It can be plugged directly into biological neural circuits to repair damage or disease. One of the challenges in building an artificial neuron is emulating a real neuron's non-linear responses. Scientists collected data from two types of rat neurons in order to build a model that emulated how neurons responded to stimuli from other nerves. The chip is roughly 0.1 millimeters in diameter and it only uses 140 nanoWatts of power, making it practical for long-term applications inside the body. Potential applications for the technology include repairing defective circuits that cause conditions like heart failure or sleep apnea, replacing damaged nerves caused by spinal injuries, or helping connect robotic limbs to people's nervous systems.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen_us%2Farticle%2Fpkebx9%2Fscientists-found-ancient-never-before-seen-viruses-in-a-glacier/1/0100016fae041db1-f5af2317-fddf-4cfa-8680-557d8a6e9201-000000/5k5aq3MlZPnJemJqhcxP79VM4CkhnoS0XV3uaXoi71I=124" target="_blank">Scientists Found Ancient, Never-Before-Seen Viruses in a Glacier (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Evidence of ancient viruses has been found deep within the glaciers atop the Tibetan Plateau. These viral records can help scientists gain data on Earth's evolutionary and climate history. Genomes from 33 groups of viruses were found in the ice, 28 that were completely new to science. Studying viruses from ice cores is difficult due to the extremely small size of the viruses and how easy it is to contaminate samples. Decontamination techniques are used to clean the samples. Warming temperatures are causing glaciers around the world to shrink and release trapped microbes and viruses. This has caused disease outbreaks in the past, and it is a concern for the future as the planet continues to warm up.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdevdegree.ca%2F/1/0100016fae041db1-f5af2317-fddf-4cfa-8680-557d8a6e9201-000000/C7XRJkQtfTMAuf7zye2vcMFzu61hcmnYjbEujm7hE68=124" target="_blank">Dev Degree (Website)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Dev Degree is a learning program that combines hands-on developer experience at Shopify with an accredited Computer Science degree.

A large amount of electronic waste is generated from smartphones requiring different charging ports, and the change to a standardized port would make users' lives easier. The Radio Equipment Directive demanded the change in 2014, but the initiative was turned down. Apple has stated that changing to a common charger for all smartphones would be bad for the environment and freeze innovation. Around a billion Apple devices are using the lightning port, and the introduction of a common charger will result in an immediate increase in electronic waste, defeating the motive behind the directive. Apple may adopt a Type-C USB port in the next iPhone since it has already been introduced in the iPad and MacBook.</p> <br><br>

Plaid's API software is used by many companies to connect to users' bank accounts. One in four people in the United States with bank accounts has used Plaid's services. Visa was an early investor in the start-up, along with Mastercard, Citi, American Express, and Goldman Sachs. Plaid has seen a compound annual growth rate of roughly 100% since 2015. Its customer base doubled from 2017 to 2018 and has expanded to the UK and Canada. Visa has estimated that the deal could add up to 100 basis points to the company's net revenue growth by 2021.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.inputmag.com%2Ftech%2Fmicrosoft-is-replacing-edge-with-its-new-chromium-browser-next-week/1/0100016fa3c2d16c-eb860901-ea3a-4ce6-b331-30a687a99859-000000/o6JaVdpOrn1KFDEjUDzHNYABUsb0Tvcx_pIwzPYDePs=123" target="_blank">Microsoft is replacing Edge with its new Chromium browser next week (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Microsoft's Edge browser will be upgraded to the Chromium-based version on January 15. Windows 10 users will be automatically transitioned to the new version. The launch date was announced last month, but it wasn't clear if existing users would be pushed to the new version. Enterprise customers will have a choice to stay on the Edge version. The new version will look mostly the same, but it will be able to support all Chrome's extensions. Web developers will no longer have to test for both Edge and Chrome versions of their websites, as they will now share the same rendering engines. Apple was briefly rumored to have considered changing Safari to a Chromium base.

The machines are less than 1mm long and can be programmed. When damaged, the robots can heal themselves, and when their tasks are done, they can die and decay. These features make them ideal for tasks like cleaning up microplastic pollution in the oceans, locating and digesting toxic materials, drug delivery in the body, or removing plaque from artery walls. The robots are designed by an evolutionary algorithm that runs on a supercomputer. It runs tests in virtual environments to see which designs are the best, and then after about 100 generations, a design is chosen to be built in the lab. They have blood vessels, nervous systems, and sensory cells. Some groups have raised concerns over the ethics of the creation and use of these robots.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-southkorea-artificial-intelligence-jo%2Fsmile-with-your-eyes-how-to-beat-south-koreas-ai-hiring-bots-and-land-a-job-idUSKBN1ZC022/1/0100016fa3c2d16c-eb860901-ea3a-4ce6-b331-30a687a99859-000000/yZB_0s3yKg3EHBnGf6_SLHvE9GSpaBo1P9qq6FskeRE=123" target="_blank">'Smile with your eyes': How to beat South Korea's AI hiring bots and land a job (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Top Korean firms are rolling out artificial intelligence in hiring, and job seekers are learning how to beat the bots. Career consultants are now offering classes on how to handle recruitment screening by computers. These systems use facial recognition technology to analyze potential employees, so job seekers have to learn techniques, such as smiling with their eyes, in order to deal with the AI. Nearly a quarter of the top 131 corporations in Korea currently use or have plans to use AI in hiring. AI video interviews analyze people's emotional responses to questions and also their performance in a certain set of tasks. Some tests don't really have a correct answer, as the goal is only to analyze behavior. Many students are feeling disheartened with the introduction of AI as they feel like they are underprepared for these types of interviews, and they are concerned because the systems can easily detect if they make something up.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falan-turing-institute%2FCleverCSV/1/0100016fa3c2d16c-eb860901-ea3a-4ce6-b331-30a687a99859-000000/SyKL6TUQiWBjMNewSFopPbdGClJG35mPMVrI0eom3dQ=123" target="_blank">CleverCSV (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">CSV is a great format, but it has too many different variations with its formatting and it can get messy dealing with CSV files of different types all the time.

(8 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The movement to 'no code' has gained momentum over the last couple of years. No code is an ideal where business logic, and even entire applications, can be written without having the training of a software developer. Software developers can be expensive, and the work that is outputted is usually slow, highly variable, and requires ongoing maintenance. The need for software is clear, but developing it is expensive and risky. While the idea of being able to create software using business logic in plain language form sounds great, there are some fundamental flaws with the concept. Programming languages have been attempting to simplify programming since early in the industry, but the reality is that abstract code is required for many applications. Simple syntax removes a lot of expression and flexibility. Many programs can change 'coding' into a series of configurations, but these programs have very specific applications and are not suitable for general use. They also take away a lot of flexibility with the logic. 'No code' will still have its uses, such as putting together proof-of-concepts for projects, but it is likely that software developers will still be needed for most software development scenarios.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Miscellaneous</span><br>Random stuff techies might be interested in</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Ftheglobepost.com%2F2020%2F01%2F13%2Firan-internet-paradox%2F/1/0100016fa3c2d16c-eb860901-ea3a-4ce6-b331-30a687a99859-000000/CrYbZ3j4QD9J_j-_mYlBTE7EPRfiue2DyMFgap6XVUM=123" target="_blank">Iran‚Äôs Insoluble Paradox of Cutting Off the Internet (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Recent unrest in Iran has resulted in internet blackouts over the weekend. The Iranian government has denied a cover-up after an airliner was shot down last week. There was a drop in Iran's international internet access on Saturday and Sunday, and a drop in connectivity at Tehran's Sharif University on Monday ahead of any new demonstrations. Iran has used internet blackouts as a form of control during other periods of civil unrest. There is a high cost to the country's economy every time the internet is disconnected. Iran lost $1.5 billion within four days during a blackout in November. The blackouts are causing more Iranians to be aware of their oppression from their government and the power of the internet.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F1%2F13%2F21064108%2Finstacart-workers-organizing-tip-protest-delivery-default/1/0100016fa3c2d16c-eb860901-ea3a-4ce6-b331-30a687a99859-000000/kS8cDbejzjNfFbCJbUf2k3C1-942GdF4FX3ju6N7_3c=123" target="_blank">Instacart workers are organizing national boycott to reinstate a default 10 percent tip (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Instacart workers will be holding a protest against the company next week in order to push for the reinstatement of a 10 percent default tip on all orders. They plan to start a social media campaign to encourage customers to #DeleteInstacart until the company restores the 10 percent tip. Workers claim that Instacart has lowered pay steadily over the last few years, reducing the default tips from 10 percent to 5 percent in 2016. It introduced an earnings structure in 2018 that resulted in less pay for most of its laborers. Workers' tips were being factored into their minimum payments, but Instacart reversed the policy after widespread criticism. Instacart later eliminated its bonus program. An IPO may be on the horizon for Instacart, which had a valuation of around $8 billion last year.</p> <br><br>

TV makers are continuing to look for the next expensive thing to encourage consumers to upgrade. Rolling TVs, 8K, and radical bezel-less or ultra-thin designs were common at CES. While foldable screens still seem to be a while away, flexible screen technology has improved significantly. The battle between AMD and Intel seems to be ramping up, with both companies striving to create hardware for new form factors. Many companies presented concept designs at CES, but most didn't seem to have a firm purpose or direction. Smaller companies are feeling the pressure from large companies like Google, and some lawsuits were filed just hours after CES opened. Sex technology is becoming less taboo at the show. AI, 8K, and 5G are becoming more normalized and less worshipped as a technology.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbooks%2F2020%2Fjan%2F09%2Fworld-without-work-david-susskind-review/1/0100016f9e9c7570-4700de73-104d-47b8-bae5-6f732d230024-000000/ep61d032BqVX71djqP-l8p_ydFC0JN3P4cp3E9BnyNg=123" target="_blank">A World Without Work by Daniel Susskind review ‚Äì should we be delighted or terrified? (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Writers have long been imagining a world where machines replace humans, freeing humans up from having to work and the consequences of the switch to an automated world. Many of these imaginings end up in a dystopian world where the majority of humans are doomed to live empty lives of poverty and despair. Daniel Susskind is an economics scholar and a former government policy advisor. His book, 'A World Without Work', paints the picture of the future with predictions borne from reason. Automation has replaced human labor in routine tasks throughout the last couple of centuries without destroying entire occupations. It has even created new types of jobs. However, as technology improves, it seems inevitable that the number of jobs will start to decrease. Different ways of wealth distribution will need to be implemented, as well as ways to distribute the amount of work left. People will need to rethink what a 'meaningful life' actually means, as the importance of work will start to fade away.</p> <br><br>

While Facebook was able to give many people a voice, it hasn't yet brought about a generational change in addressing important issues. Hopefully, things will start to become different this coming decade. Social media is likely to change significantly in the next few years, and Zuckerberg thinks that this will mean that many smaller communities will start to appear. Facebook has already opened up many opportunities for businesses, and the number of opportunities will only continue to grow. Augmented reality is improving and will likely become the next computing platform. All these technological changes mean that new laws will be made to govern them.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F1%2F9%2F21058589%2Flime-scooter-layoff-shuting-down-12-markets/1/0100016f8f298c9d-4f222458-69e0-4e8f-9cbf-f4e0428f9039-000000/1BUCsEPO5mbdUyveVX38ijGpO9TXPiuAVUK2dnWfMiY=123" target="_blank">Scooter startup Lime is laying off 14 percent of its workers and exiting 12 markets (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Lime, an electric scooter-sharing company, will be leaving 12 cities and firing 100 workers as part of its goals to reach financial independence in 2020. Scooter sharing companies have struggled to become profitable. Most experts agree that the market is oversaturated and needs to consolidate. Lime lost approximately $300 million in 2019, likely due to the depreciation of its electric scooters and the cost of repairs. Joe Kraus, Lime's president, claims that Lime is close to being profitable, and he denied rumors that Lime was seeking a new round of venture capital investment.

The new robots are able to collect items about 10 times faster than a human worker. Walmart is transitioning into an increasingly automated model, and it is hiring fewer workers as a result. Brick and mortar retail stores are struggling against online-only sites. Walmart offers a service where customers can place orders online and have them delivered to their home or to the store parking lot. This system has issues, such as keeping track of stock, and using robots will significantly improve the service. Walmart already employs a fleet of robots that can scan store shelves three times faster than humans can. Brick and mortar companies have the added cost of maintaining a physical retail space, and so it makes sense that they will try to cut costs in order to remain competitive.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Fstory%2Fanimals%2Fcuttlefish-depth-perception-3d-glasses%2F/1/0100016f8f298c9d-4f222458-69e0-4e8f-9cbf-f4e0428f9039-000000/8diJZYEFWd_5LykGmnnXGrPO8QF7WHmkhPdIF8nnzMg=123" target="_blank">Cuttlefish perceive depth‚Äîand they wore 3D glasses to prove it (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Our brain perceives what we see in 3D by processing and combining the images from both of our eyes. A new study shows that cuttlefish also perceive the world similarly. The study equipped cuttlefish with little 3D glasses and placed them in front of a screen with a 3D movie of a shrimp passing by. When the cuttlefish saw the shrimp, they attempted to grab it with their tentacles. This behavior shows that cuttlefish are capable of binocular vision. Many other animals also share similar vision systems. While other animals have eyes that look at the same thing at the same time, cuttlefish eyes are able to move independently from each other. This study demonstrates an example of convergent evolution.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdystroy.org%2Fbroot%2F/1/0100016f8f298c9d-4f222458-69e0-4e8f-9cbf-f4e0428f9039-000000/RtOhr3NwTOTcoQmTWohrGWSKlWJtwHAQkYXWdfs5_lQ=123" target="_blank">Broot (Software Tool)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Broot is a tool for navigating directories.

It has threatened several media outlets over the publishing of a leaked catalog. The catalog contains many unusual items, including a hidden microphone designed to be worn on a user's teeth and tools for gaining entry into buildings. SSG has relationships with a wide range of US agencies. A link to the catalog is available in the article.</p> <br><br>

The company is less than two years old. Last week it presented the fish in several dishes at an event at San Diego Bay. BlueNalu claims that their meat is no different from products like Greek yogurt, ketchup, or Oreos, all of which are created in labs. Wild Type is a San Francisco-based company that is creating lab-grown salmon, but its meat falls apart when cooked at high temperatures, unlike BlueNalu's yellowtail fish fillets. One of BlueNalu's biggest challenges is to scale up their operations. It plans to launch its seafood products into a test market within two years.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FIsrael-News%2FIsraels-Defense-Ministry-announces-breakthrough-in-laser-technology-613568/1/0100016f8a02d59f-92268f47-d079-4bc5-b37a-275da2a8ce05-000000/UBoied17-h1DA3WN7X0dV_isu9NgYxc1lgRQNCLGMGs=123" target="_blank">Israel unveils breakthrough laser to intercept missiles, aerial threats (3 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Israel's Defense Ministry has created a laser that can intercept rockets and antitank guided missiles. It is based on a precision laser beam that can be focused on long-range targets and overcome atmospheric disturbances such as clouds and dust storms. Several high-energy electric laser beams are connected into one strong beam using an advanced algorithm. High-energy lasers are able to be used continually at a low cost. The weapon can be used as long as there is electricity. Israel's Defense Ministry has launched three programs that will use the laser system on the ground, on a maneuverable platform-mounted system, and in the air. There will be several trials of the weapon throughout the year, and if it is effective, it will be deployed to the Gaza border area.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhackernoon.com%2Fthe-six-most-important-things-junior-developers-need-to-know-to-begin-and-sustain-their-it-careers-vir3tkt/1/0100016f8a02d59f-92268f47-d079-4bc5-b37a-275da2a8ce05-000000/LkyfJJPYInblvBezLJaFp4oj8K04v3zgax5dUoPEjbI=123" target="_blank">6 Most Important Things Every Junior Developer Should Know (5 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">You don't need a computer science degree to become a software developer.

The ability to learn is vital since the field is always changing. Knowing the key concepts of programming will help you adapt, as while languages, frameworks, platforms, and other things might change, the core concepts will stay the same. Always try to see if there are existing libraries in order to save time. Reading other people's code is a great way to learn how others have solved problems. You do not have to learn all by yourself. There are many resources and forums out there. Finding help in the form of a mentor can be very beneficial in your career development.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbeefytech%2FBeef/1/0100016f8a02d59f-92268f47-d079-4bc5-b37a-275da2a8ce05-000000/F4HWhdF2IGFJKze5uMP6sV1ZToGphrKemu7j1Gkj7kY=123" target="_blank">Beef Programming Language (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Beef is an open-source performance-oriented compiled programming language.

It appears that the company is building realistic human avatars that can be used for entertainment and business purposes. The Core R3 technology used in Neon can autonomously create new expressions, movements, and dialog, all of which can be completely different from the original captured data. A video was leaked that shows lifelike human figures that may have been generated with Core R3. It is still unclear to what extent the avatars in the videos were computer-generated. A big claim with Neon is that the avatars can be mistaken for real humans. The leaked footage can be viewed in the article.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2020%2F01%2F06%2Falexa-pays-for-gas-at-exxonmobil-pumps%2F/1/0100016f7fb470eb-345be97f-3865-4290-8f57-fa39b02ed04e-000000/JgkR7ffuRkTLXXWM3zB8adq637Ie75fo_jphmvL2xOQ=122" target="_blank">Alexa will help pay for your gas at ExxonMobil pumps (1 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">ExxonMobil and Fiserv are developing an Alexa skill that will help users pay for gas at Exxon and Mobil stations across the US.

Some of these videos became so popular, her songs entered the charts in Japan. Miku has since collaborated with Pharrell and Lady Gaga and has toured around the world.

He claimed that he was set up by rivals at Nissan, and was released on bail. The Japanese criminal justice system has a near-perfect conviction rate, and on December 29, Ghosn left Japan for Lebanon. Ghosn released a statement on New Year's Eve denouncing the Japanese justice system. Japanese authorities have yet to determine how Ghosn escaped the country. Lebanese authorities say he entered Lebanon legally. Turkish authorities have arrested four pilots, two ground handlers, and the operations manager of a cargo company for their involvement in the escape. Interpol has issued a 'red notice' for Ghosn.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fktvz.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftechnology%2F2020%2F01%2F02%2Fapple-patents-surround-sound-like-technology-for-a-macbook%2F/1/0100016f6b1cc4d3-092ec41a-b270-457a-b942-ba5fc104009f-000000/6CXjODGy6JQM1rtWhydS3QA2qDaGgshIiCWVFEalLEk=122" target="_blank">Apple patents surround sound-like technology for a MacBook (2 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Apple has won a patent for a surround sound-like technology that will make watching media on a laptop feel significantly more immersive.

Sound has been a focus for Apple as they try to create the best experience for consuming Apple TV+ content on a Mac.

Scientists have just developed the world's smallest particle accelerator at 30 microns across, which is about half the width of a human hair. The particle accelerator was designed to be installed on a chip and will open up possibilities in materials science, chemistry, and medicine. It is called a dielectric laser accelerator (DLA), and the technology could lead to cheaper and more compact X-ray machines, radiation machines, industrial scanning equipment, and many other devices. The DLA was designed by a computer. It still needs improvement, and it will be a few more years before the DLA will be practical.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-50658537/1/0100016f6b1cc4d3-092ec41a-b270-457a-b942-ba5fc104009f-000000/ZYDUFTnIJlAZFp-Ph59LxD6oqEIFUVL75xdOthbbVrY=122" target="_blank">Barcelona's car-free smart city experiment (4 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Superblocks is an initiative by Barcelona to lower noise and pollution within its city by creating areas where all but essential vehicles are banned. There are currently six superblocks so far, each made up of nine existing blocks joined together. Parking for residents is underground. Some residents are opposed to the plan as it may lower trade in the area or because they want their cars parked outside of their homes. Other cities such as Seattle are considering introducing something similar. Barcelona has ruled citizen data as a public and individual asset and should be used solely in the public interest, meaning that it should be used to improve the quality of life in cities, rather than being used to create digital exclusion.</p><p><br><span style=" font-size: 22px;">Programming, Design &amp; Data Science</span><br>Tools, open source, and other resources for programmers, designers, and data scientists</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frq%2Frq/1/0100016f6b1cc4d3-092ec41a-b270-457a-b942-ba5fc104009f-000000/vebU-jQDR0BZjIa2pVka86eXzP4Q8v8b18Uu78RnlQE=122" target="_blank">Redis Queue (GitHub Repo)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">Redis Queue is a Python library for queueing jobs and processing them in the background with workers.

Both of them had become attached to using their mobile devices and it was beginning to make them more distant. He didn't realize how big the problem had become until they spent a weekend away to a place without an internet connection. After realizing the impact that technology had on their relationship, Clarke and Khobe started planning a year-long trip through Mongolia, a trip where they would live without being constantly connected to the world. They found the trip to be an interesting experience and will try to apply some of the lessons they learned to their everyday lives.</p><p><span style=" font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://tracking.tldrnewsletter.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2019%2F12%2F31%2Fgoogle-veterans-the-company-has-become-unrecognizable.html/1/0100016f6b1cc4d3-092ec41a-b270-457a-b942-ba5fc104009f-000000/hcV99yPb1nJhtERSCfCjYLbXDDqH0brfkvhL8Zcsn2o=122" target="_blank">Google veterans: The company has become 'unrecognizable' (7 minute read)</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px;">The resignations of Larry Page and Sergey Brin from their roles as CEO and president of Alphabet marked the end of an era.

Current CEO Sundar Pichai has admitted the difficulties in managing more than 100,000 employees. The size of the company has made it hard for things to change, and more employees are starting to leave the company due to the increased bureaucracy.</p> <br><br>

The climate crisis will likely be to this century what the two world wars were to the previous one. It will require a re-allocation of capital that will result in cleaner energy and efforts to protect the environment. Automation will continue to lower the cost of production and services, and this will change how we work and distribute wealth. China will become the world's dominant superpower while the US becomes more internally focused and isolated. Cryptocurrencies will become the norm, and this will be led by China as the US and Europe will struggle with slow regulatory changes. A decentralized internet will emerge. Much of the world's food production will move to laboratories, with plant-based food diets becoming dominant by the end of the decade. Mass surveillance by governments and corporations will become normal, and new products will emerge for people to protect their privacy. A new generation will start dominating many institutions, meaning age and experience will be less valued by shareholders, voters, and other stakeholders. Progress in genetics will mean we start winning the fight against cancer and other terminal illnesses. Fertility and reproduction will also significantly change. There will be an era of genetic inequality and moral confusion.</p> <br><br>
